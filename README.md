# RoomForWatch
This app was built to understand MVVM and other libraries.(the app is still raw)</br>
App Stack - MVVM, Retrofit + OkHttp, Dagger 2(for every task its own Component), Coruotine Flow(do all work), LiveData(only for update UI).</br>
For navigation uses - bottomNavigation + Navigation Components. </br>
I used a AdapterDelegates for RecyclerAdapter, also -Data and ViewBinding for its work.</br>
When data is not available I implemented something like a plug(other XML layout)</br>
There is a soil to create a data cache. </br>

I tried to do an app with the right and clean architecture, also using best practice developing.</br>
